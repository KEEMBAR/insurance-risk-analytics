# Insurance Risk Analytics Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes historical car insurance claim data for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) to optimize marketing strategy and identify low-risk targets for premium reduction. The analysis spans from February 2014 to August 2015 and includes various features about policies, clients, vehicles, and claims.

please if anything left please tell me from task-2

Based on your progress and your screenshot, here’s a checklist for Task 2 and what you should double-check or finish:
Task 2 Checklist

1. DVC Local Remote Setup
   [x] Create a storage directory (e.g., ~/dvc_storage)
   [x] Add it as a DVC remote
   dvc remote add -d localstorage ~/dvc_storage
2. Data Tracking
   [x] Add your data to DVC
   dvc add data/raw/MachineLearningRating_v3.txt
   [x] Commit the .dvc file and DVC config to Git
   git add data/raw/MachineLearningRating_v3.txt.dvc .dvc/config .dvcignore
   git commit -m "Track data with DVC and configure local remote"
3. Push Data to DVC Remote
   [x] Push your data to the remote
   dvc push
4. Push Code and Metadata to GitHub
   [x] Push your code and DVC metadata to GitHub
   git push origin task-2 (and/or main)
5. Documentation
   [ ] Document your DVC setup and data versioning
   Add a section in your README.md or a separate markdown file explaining:
   How to set up DVC
   How to pull data (dvc pull)
   How to add new data versions
6. (Optional but recommended) Test Reproducibility
   [ ] Clone your repo in a new folder and run:
   dvc pull
   This ensures your data can be restored from the remote.
7. (Optional) Clean up branches
   [ ] Merge task-2 into main when Task 2 is complete (via PR or git merge).
   What Might Be Left for You:
   Add a short DVC usage section to your README (or a new file, e.g., docs/DVC_SETUP.md).
   Test your DVC remote by running dvc pull in a fresh clone (optional, but good practice).
   Push your task-2 branch to GitHub if you haven’t already.
   Merge task-2 into main when you’re done.
   Sample README Section for DVC
   Apply to README.md
   If you check off everything above, Task 2 is complete!
   Let me know if you want help with the README section or want to test your DVC remote.
   okay let me merge tesk-2 i mean let push it andd add

Perfect! Here’s a quick checklist and the commands you’ll need to push your task-2 branch and then merge it into main:

1. Make sure all your changes are committed on task-2:
   Apply to README.md
   Run
   If you see uncommitted changes, add and commit them:
   Apply to README.md
   Run
2. Push your task-2 branch to GitHub:
   Apply to README.md
   Run
3. Merge task-2 into main:
   Option A: On GitHub (Recommended)
   Go to your repository on GitHub.
   You should see a “Compare & pull request” button for task-2 → main.
   Click it, review, and merge.
   Option B: On the command line
   Apply to README.md
   Run
4. (Optional) Delete the task-2 branch after merging:
   Apply to README.md
   Run
   You’re all set!
   Let me know if you hit any issues or want help writing your merge/pull request message.
   please allow me to run the commands here then you will se the ouput and i will comment that

Absolutely!
Please go ahead and run the commands in your terminal.
After each step, share the output or any messages you see here, and I’ll help you interpret or troubleshoot as needed.
Just let me know when you’re ready for the next step or if you have any questions about the output!
This output is correct and expected for a DVC-tracked data file!
data/raw/MachineLearningRating_v3.txt is untracked by Git (as it should be).
The actual data file is tracked by DVC, not Git.
Only the .dvc pointer file (e.g., MachineLearningRating_v3.txt.dvc) should be tracked by Git.
You do NOT need to add the actual data file to Git.
Just make sure you have committed the .dvc file and DVC config files.
What to do next:
Check which files are staged and committed:
Apply to README.md
Run
If you see any .dvc files or DVC config files not yet committed, add and commit them:
Apply to README.md
Run
Then push your branch:
Apply to README.md
Run
Let me know the output of these commands or if you have any questions!
i merged task-2 busst pot i want to update readme is iible to uopdate and remerge it

Yes, it is absolutely possible (and common!) to update your README after merging a branch. Here’s how you can do it:
How to Update Your README After Merging
Checkout the branch you want to update (usually main):
Apply to README.md
Run
Edit your README.md file as needed.
Add and commit your changes:
Apply to README.md
Run
Push your changes to GitHub:
Apply to README.md
Run
If you want to use a feature branch (recommended for teamwork):
Create a new branch for the update:
Apply to README.md
Run
Edit, add, and commit as above.
Push the branch:
Apply to README.md
Run
Open a Pull Request on GitHub to merge update-readme into main.
Summary:
You can update and re-merge as many times as you need!
Just make sure to pull the latest changes before editing, and use branches for best practice.
Let me know if you want a sample README section or help with the update!
this is the readme writeten before please update considering all task-1 and task-2 done

Here’s an updated README.md section that reflects the completion of Task 1 (EDA & Statistics) and Task 2 (DVC & Data Pipeline), and gives clear instructions for reproducibility:
Apply to README.md
insurance-risk-analytics/
├── data/ # Raw and processed data tracked by DVC
├── notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks for analysis
├── src/ # Source code
├── tests/ # Unit tests
├── outputs/ # Outputs like plots and reports
└── docs/ # Documentation

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd insurance-risk-analytics
   ```

2. **Create and activate the environment:**

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate insurance-risk-analytics
   ```

3. **Install DVC (if not already installed):**

   ```bash
   pip install dvc
   ```

4. **Pull the data from DVC remote:**
   ```bash
   dvc pull
   ```

## Data Version Control (DVC)

- The project uses DVC to track and version data files.
- Data is **not stored in Git**; only small `.dvc` pointer files are.
- To add new data or update, use:
  ```bash
  dvc add data/raw/your_file.csv
  git add data/raw/your_file.csv.dvc .dvc/config .dvcignore
  git commit -m "Add new data version"
  dvc push
  ```

## Project Tasks & Progress

### Task 1: EDA & Statistics (✅ Completed)

- Data understanding and quality assessment
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with summary statistics, distributions, outlier detection, and visualizations
- Key findings summarized for data quality, geographic, and vehicle risk patterns

### Task 2: Data Version Control (✅ Completed)

- DVC initialized and configured with a local remote
- Data tracked and versioned with DVC
- Data pipeline is reproducible and auditable

### Task 3: Hypothesis Testing (Next)

- Risk differences across provinces, zip codes, and genders
- Margin differences between zip codes

### Task 4: Predictive Modeling (Next)

- Claim severity prediction
- Premium optimization
- Model interpretation and feature importance

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repo and set up the environment as above.
2. Run `dvc pull` to get the data.
3. Open and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for EDA and further analysis.
